	"heist_no_mercy_ranted_brief": "We are hitting up the Mercy Hospital in a heist for blood. The source is carrying some kind of rare virus and we need to get it out of him. Let nothing stop us as the paycheck is a hefty one. Spilling some blood for this kind of cash is not the end of the world."

	"heist_nmh_res_brief": "Our client needs a blood sample from a patient being kept in the isolation ward of Mercy Hospital. You gotta go in there, take out the surveillance, subdue the civilians and get me into the patient database so I can ID the guy. With the security in this place, it should be a nice clean job. I'll get you out via the roof when you're done. This job is a little shady, brokered through a third part, got some some serious shadow-company military industrial vibes, but worth the risk. The payday is something we're gonna need in the future, plus a nice cash bonus."
